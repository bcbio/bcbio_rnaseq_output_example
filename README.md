## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This repo contains example output data (2 vs 2) from a bcbio RNAseq analysis. It's being used to test [bcbioRnaseq](https://github.com/hbc/bcbioRnaseq) R package to continue with the analysis and it keeps a copy of the last report that it generates.

### Support or Contact
