## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This repo contains example output data from a bcbio RNAseq analysis. It's being used to test [bcbioRnaseq](https://github.com/hbc/bcbioRnaseq) R package to continue with the analysis and it keeps a copy of the last report that it generates.

* Example of [QC report](http://bcb.io/bcbio_rnaseq_output_example/qc.html)
* Example of DE report (coming soon)
